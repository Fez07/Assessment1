### Personal Information

My name is Theo Constas, I am 19 years old, and I am from Melbourne, Australia, a place that I was born and have lived my entire life in.

I graduated at Overnewton Anglican Community College and began studying at RMIT in 2021 in a Bachelor of Business course majoring in Marketing.

I am a 3rd generation immigrant as all my grandparents immigrated from Greece to start a new life in Australia. In my family, I have one younger brother and one older sister, making me the middle child and of course having middle child syndrome. As well in the family we have on dog who is 12 years old, and is a cross breed, being half Shih Tzu, and half Jack Russel.

I used to find difficulty finding hobbies to stick to but over time I found that I enjoyed Tennis, which however I dropped right before entering senior level competition and instead begun training in the gym for a source of fitness.

Gaming is another hobby that I enjoy, as I have great memories in games such as GTA 5, Minecraft, GMOD and much more recently Rocket League and Fortnite. My gaming hobby mixes well with my drive to socialise, as I usually only find myself gaming a lot when I am playing with friends, and if not gaming, I enjoy spending time with my friends going out drinking or doing activities.

My goals for the future are to become wealthy to the point where I could pass down wealth to give future generations a somewhat more comfortable lifestyle. Goals for myself are to also explore the world, visiting countries for their unique cultures, languages and nature.
