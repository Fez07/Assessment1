# My Profile

### Personal Information
<img src="profilepic.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

My name is Theo Constas, I am 19 years old, and I am from Melbourne, Australia, a place that I was born and have lived my entire life in.

I graduated at Overnewton Anglican Community College and began studying at RMIT in 2021 in a Bachelor of Business course majoring in Marketing.

I am a 3rd generation immigrant as all my grandparents immigrated from Greece to start a new life in Australia. In my family, I have one younger brother and one older sister, making me the middle child and of course having middle child syndrome. As well in the family we have on dog who is 12 years old, and is a cross breed, being half Shih Tzu, and half Jack Russel.

I used to find difficulty finding hobbies to stick to but over time I found that I enjoyed Tennis, which however I dropped right before entering senior level competition and instead begun training in the gym for a source of fitness.

Gaming is another hobby that I enjoy, as I have great memories in games such as GTA 5, Minecraft, GMOD and much more recently Rocket League and Fortnite. My gaming hobby mixes well with my drive to socialise, as I usually only find myself gaming a lot when I am playing with friends, and if not gaming, I enjoy spending time with my friends going out drinking or doing activities.

My goals for the future are to become wealthy to the point where I could pass down wealth to give future generations a somewhat more comfortable lifestyle. Goals for myself are to also explore the world, visiting countries for their unique cultures, languages and nature.


### Interest in IT
My interest in business has always led me to the concept of innovation, making society a little better than it currently is. My personal beliefs is that in the modern day, this is achieved through the development of technology, whether or not it is essential or not. My belief is that knowledge in IT is necessary for people who want to go forward into the future with an understanding in how the world works, which is why I attempt to fill my elective classes with subjects that can teach me basics of coding languages or develop my understanding in Information technology.

I believe that in my studies in business and IT, I can go down my own path towards entrepreneurship, and explore my own way to innovate and bring a new service/product to society that can make it that one little bit better, in which I can learn the skills to do so with these classes.


### Ideal Job
<img src="job.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

My ideal first job is one in marketing, something that will allow me to gain experience in how the operations of marketing are properly run in a business for a certain amount of time. This can allow me to also see other aspects of how a business is run, allowing me to decide what the next stage in my life would be, whether it would be to slowly pick up my own ventures or to start my own business and pursue my desire of innovation.

### Personal Profile
##### Myers-Briggs
<img src="16personalities.png" alt="drawing" width="120"/>

The 16 personalities test results labelled me as an entertainer, stating that I love being around friends and soaking up attention and having a fun time, whilst also ensuring that those around me are having just as great of a time.

This test labelled me as 70% extroverted, as well as 58% observant, showing my ability to speak when I need to and hold good conversations whilst also having the ability to get things done when they need to. This can greatly benefit a teamwork situation.

##### Learning Style
<img src="vark.png" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

The Vark Questionnaire was used as a test for the learning style was used to determine my learning style. It asked which forms information sharing were easiest to learn from, and the test results in the end stated that my learning preferences were multimodal.

Multimodal means that I prefer to learn from multiple sources of information at once, including visual, audible and of example from others.

This can be appropriate in a team setting as conversing and sharing information can be made easier by myself to others, as well as better used in presentations.

The results also show my desire for trial and error, sharing that I prefer to make mistakes in order to better improve my work.

##### Creativity

The creativity test which I took was from AULIVE titled “test my creativity”, which gave me a score of 54.11, lower than the average score of 62.83. Although below average, the test ranked my curiosity, paradox and complexity at a higher level than connection, persistence and boldness.

This means that I may want to change things that are considered the norm and can find relationships between information that I am given. This can help with problem solving that may occur in the situation of being in a team.


### Project Idea
Taking concepts from apps/websites such as LinkedIn, Instagram and Tinder, this idea is more formal and for small businesses to be able to quickly access a source of resources easily without having to search as hard. This project will provide an easy link in which small businesses and users can look through each other’s information, and then like or right depending on how they agree with the information provided to them, and then matches can be made in which a user and a business seeking a social media manager can be in contact.

In Australia, small businesses make up a large contribution to the economy, with, of all businesses, “98%” of them or “2.35 million” (ABA) are small businesses. Of those businesses, ones such as real estate, financial services and retail, who usually interact with consumers the most, may seek out social media to find more ways to market themselves in this modernising world. From these 3 industries, “615,990” (ABA) small businesses may still be in search of social media managers. These statistics show that there will always be a demand for these services, and there can be easier ways to provide this service to these small businesses.

When creating an account, the user can state whether they are applying to listed as a small business or as someone who has an interest in managing a small business’ social media. Social media managers can create a description like that of a resume, which describes all the skills that they can bring to the table, and experience that they hold, and can link their own resumes, as well as past work. Social media managers can add in what is expected for themselves, in terms of pay, however it could always be negotiated. Small businesses similarly can add the work that is required from managers and the pay that they are willing to give out to potential managers.

The interface will be shown like Instagram or TikTok, where users can scroll to different profiles and find the information. Managers will only see small businesses, and small businesses will only see managers. There would be the ability to like or swipe right on a profile if they wish to interact with one another. However, to begin contact, both parties must like each other’s profile as it shows they approve of the experience/work expected and want to build communications. There would be a separate page for a party to see likes that have happened in a time of inactivity to better find matches. This page would allow the user to like or dislike, as disliking will cause the profile to never appear on said users main page again. There will also be a page exclusively for managers, allowing them to work together.

A system for managers that allows them to work together will contain features for making work easier, increasing the quality of work available for small businesses. Managers may be able to collaborate, by finding other managers through a similar like/swipe page on the main screen, and collaborate with one another, through sharing ideas, or recommendations to small businesses through each other’s connections. Managers may also try to form shared accounts, so larger small businesses who may be looking for more traffic will seek out 2 instead of one manager. This feature will allow for better access to resources for small businesses and managers alike.

There will also be a rating system, through the typical 5-star system, where a small business can rate managers work when they are complete or as they are doing it, to allow other small businesses to have an understanding on the level of work that they may receive when hiring someone. This can also allow managers to determine the level of pay that they require in terms of competitiveness and in what percentile they are in the level of skill they have in terms of other managers on the app. Another system of ranking is a medal system, where a business can rank a manager with a gold/silver/bronze medal based on the work they received and success of the social media manager’s input. The medals will be put on the managers profiles to show how many they have of each medal to show their overall success in managing small business social medias.

Languages needed for app/website development that would help in the creation of this application are Java, HTML/CSS and others. However, my own lack of knowledge in these languages may require me to learn them properly using other software and/or education services or seek out a service which would allow someone else’s knowledge/skills to development it for me.

The purpose of this software would be to better allow small businesses to seek out social media managers for furthering their reach out into their chosen industries. As someone in marketing/business course, this area is somewhere in which I am knowledgeable, and can support the idea that social media has become more important if not necessary to the survival and adaptation of businesses into this new world. Social media managers are becoming just as important to businesses as a person conducting marketing or human resources, and this app will provide the means for a business to easily access these resources.
